üîç Real-Time Object Detection System
A computer vision application developed using OpenCV that performs real-time object detection and classification from webcam/video stream input. The system leverages classical techniques and/or pre-trained deep learning models (such as Haar Cascades, YOLO, or MobileNet-SSD) to identify and label multiple objects with bounding boxes in live video feeds.

Key Features:

Real-time video capture and object detection

Integration with OpenCV for image processing

Object classification with visual annotations

Lightweight and suitable for basic hardware setups

Modular and easy to customize for different object classes or models

Technologies Used:
Python | OpenCV | NumPy | (Optional: TensorFlow, YOLO, etc.)
